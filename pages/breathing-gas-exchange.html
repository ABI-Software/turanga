		<h1>The Lungs</h1>
		<h2>Healthy gas exchange</h2>
		<p>The lungs have about 30,000 airways that transport oxygen and carbon dioxide to/from the gas exchange units that are deep within the lungs.</p>
		<p>Lungs also have blood vessels that bring blood to the gas exchange units, &amp; transport oxygenated blood to the heart for delivery to the body.</p>
		<p>Gas exchange works best when the same amount of air and blood is delivered to a gas exchange unit.</p>
		<p>Lung disease affects the amount of air or blood that is delivered to the gas exchange units: some get too much, and some get too little.</p>

		<p>In the graph the <font color="blue">Blue</font> line is air and the <font color="red">Red</font> line is blood.</p>
		<p>The colours show how much air gets to the gas exchange units. In the model colours towards <font color="blue">Blue</font> is low, and colours toward <font color="red">Red</font> is high.</p>
