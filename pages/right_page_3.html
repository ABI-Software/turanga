<p>When the airways constrict during an asthma attack, this causes the air delivery to be ‘patchy’. Some patches of lung get a small amount of air, and others get more air than usual.</p>

<ul>
<li>Gas exchange is worse</li>
<li>The breathing muscles have to work harder to breathe</li>
<li>Much more energy is required just to breathe, which is distressing for the patient</li>
</ul>

<p>In this model:</p>

<ul>
<li><font color="green">Green</font> is good</li>
<li><font color="red">Red</font> is too high</li>
<li><font color="blue">Blue</font> is too low</li>
</ul>
