<h1>Asthma</h1>
<p>Asthma causes airways to become smaller in size. The smooth muscle that wraps around the airways constricts, and the airways secrete mucus.</p>

<p>This makes it much harder for air to flow through the airways, and the amount of ventilation that goes to some of the gas exchange units is reduced or zero.</p>

<p>Select an option under the lung to see how air delivery to the gas exchange units is affected in MILD, MODERATE, and SEVERE asthma.</p>
