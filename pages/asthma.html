		<h1>Asthma</h1>
		<p>Asthma causes airways to become smaller in size. The smooth muscle that wraps around the airways constricts, and the airways secrete mucus.</p>
		<p>This makes it much harder for air to flow through the airways, and the amount of ventilation that goes to some of the gas exchange units is reduced or zero.</p>
		<p>Select an option under the lung to see how air delivery to the gas exchange units is affected in MILD, MODERATE, and SEVERE asthma.</p>

		<p>When the airways constrict during an asthma attack, this causes the air delivery to be ‘patchy’. Some patches of lung get a small amount of air, and others get more air than usual.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Gas exchange is worse</li>
			<li>The breathing muscles have to work harder to breathe</li>
			<li>Much more energy is required just to breathe, which is distressing for the patient</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li><font color="green">Green</font> is good</li>
			<li><font color="red">Red</font> is too high</li>
			<li><font color="blue">Blue</font> is too low</li>
